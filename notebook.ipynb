There should be a unique row for each activity/health visit. \n\nWhere missing values are permitted, they should be in the default Python format.\n\n|Column Name | Description |\n|-------|-------|\n| pet_id | Unique identifier for each pet. There should not be any missing values.|\n| date | The date of the activity recorded or the date of the health visit, in date format. There should not be any missing values.|\n| activity_type | The type of activity, one of 'Walking', 'Playing', 'Resting' or for rows that relate to a health visit, the value 'Health'. Missing values are permitted.|\n| duration_minutes | The duration of the activity in minutes. For rows that relate to health visits, this should be 0. Missing values for other activities are permitted.|\n| issue | The health issue identified or check-up note. For rows that relate to activities, this should be a missing value. Missing values for health activities are permitted.|\n| resolution | The outcome or advice given for the issue. For rows that relate to activities, this should be a missing value. Missing values for health activities are permitted.|\n| owner_id | Unique identifier for the pet owner. All pets must have an owner.|\n| owner_age_group | The age group of the owner (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.). Missing values are permitted.|\n| pet_type | The type of pet (e.g., Dog, Cat).
